        <h1><u>Game Play</u></h1>
        <h1>The game consists of up to 50 players falling from a parachute on an island in search of weapons and equipment to kill the other players. Players are free to choose their starting position, take weapons and supplies to extend their battle life.</h1>
        <h1>When players join a game, they will enter a plane, which will fly over the island. While the plane is flying over the island, the players can jump where they want, thus allowing them to choose a strategic place to land away from enemies. After landing, the players must then go looking for weapons and utility items. Medical equipment, medium and large weapons, grenades, and other items featured can be found throughout the island. The ultimate goal of the players is to survive on the island with a maximum of 50-51 players online; this requires eliminating all opponents the players encounter along the way and ensuring that they are the only survivor remaining. The available safe area of the game's map decreases in size over time, directing the surviving players into tighter areas to force encounters. The last player or team standing wins the round.</h1>
