         <h1 align="center" style="color: white;">My Mother Parents are the source of our life on earth. The person whom I love very much is my mother. My motherâ€™s name is Airin Akter. She is thirty years old. She is an school teacher. There are many qualities in her. She is very gentle, polite, affectionate, religious and intelligent. She plays many duties in the family. She always keeps our house neat and clean. She looks after me and other members of the family. She always thinks of our comfort. She is very conscious about my studies also. She always expects my bright future. She wants me to be well educated and established in life. She becomes very happy when I cut a good figure in the examination. She is my first teacher because at first, she taught me writing and reading. She is very religious and kind-hearted. Every day she gets up very early in the morning, says the prayer and reads the Quran. She always gives us the advice to lead an Islamic life. She always prays to Allah for our welfare. She always teaches us to be honest, truthful and punctual. I am really proud of having such an ideal Mother. I can not think of a single moment without her.</h1>
